# Overview

I wanted to create a text game using a language that I was but fledgeling in. I decided that to amp up the coding difficulty
I would run character checks like games made by bethesda

To try and avoid micro solutions like simply using variables when the macro solutions are more universal and teach more about
structure. Classes and switches or expressions come to mind and their implementation in a broader sense of programming.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Community. This was because it is a proepr IDE that is compatible with the C++ compiler.

I used iostream and string which are basic libraries for interpreting print and string variables.

# Future Work

TODO

Implement stat print.
Add more routes and extend story
Add debugging option for new characters using a List or some other element.
